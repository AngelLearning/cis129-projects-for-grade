i=("On a hot Summer day a young boy strolled down the street feeling overwhelmed by the Sun's scorching heat.")
c=("Fortunately the boy spots an ice-cream truck off in the distance.")
e=("Out of pure excitement the boy sprints towards the truck with zero hesitation at all.")
cream=("The boy finally reaches the truck and is stunned by the amount of variety there is to choose from. The boy scuffles through his small pockets and takes out a crumbled dollar,\nhe notices he can only afford the plain vanilla cone which annoys him a bit since he doesn't like the flavor. Nonetheless, he buys the cone and eats it but shortly regrets the decision because he's lactose.")
